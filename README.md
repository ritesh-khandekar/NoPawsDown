- A system that connects the general public with numerous NGOs in the neighbourhood or nearby community.
- Users will be able to upload or publish images of dogs they want to advertise for adoption as well as information about them.
- Once the user publishes a picture of their pet, all surrounding NGOs will immediately receive the information and will be able to contact the user.
- Users will also be able to donate to NGOs to support their efforts in improving facilities and pet care
